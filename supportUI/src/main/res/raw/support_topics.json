Usually, the fee increases during sudden blockchain rate fluctuations and major world events;\n\t\t - your crypto account has a history of microdeposits (like referral bonuses). If your account has large amounts of small deposits, the size of your transaction will be bigger as it will consist of many inputs. The bigger the transaction size, the higher the blockchain fee. \n\nThere might be other causes of higher blockchain fees, but we've listed the most common ones.\n\n\n\nWhat can I do to reduce the blockchain fee in the meantime?\n\nThe general advice to reduce your blockchain fee would be:\n\n\t\t - Consolidate your microdeposits in another third-party wallet, then send a larger amount to Wirex as one single transaction. That will help you reduce the blockchain fee for future exchanges and transfers.\n\t\t - If you are used to exchanging small amounts regularly, it might help to use larger amounts.\n\t\t - Monitor the average blockchain fee in the network. If your transfer is not time-sensitive, you can wait until the average fee amount drops.
